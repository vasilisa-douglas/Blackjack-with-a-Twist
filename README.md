# Blackjack-with-a-Twist

For this project we intend to implement the popular card game of blackjack. Beyond the basic implementation of the card game we plan on introducing new elements to the game to scale the difficulty and keep the playerâ€™s interest. These new elements might affect the cards drawn, such as on the second round all even card values are halved. As blackjack is a gambling game we plan on awarding the player with points or an in-game currency when they win. This currency can then be exchanged for items that benefit the player.
